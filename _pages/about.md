I am currently an assistant professor in Software Engineering Institute at East China Normal University. 
I received my Ph.D. in College of Computer Science at Zhejiang University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Guochuan Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0096209). Before that, I was an undergrad in Chu Kochen Honors College at Zhejiang University.
During grad school, I visited Carnegie Mellon University, where I was working with Prof. [Ben Moseley](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/), Prof. [R. Ravi](https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ravi/) and Prof. [Sungjin Im](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/sim3/). 




Research Interests
======

My research interests are broadly in operations research and theoretical computer science. Recently, I mainly focus on making use of machine learned predictions to design robust algorithms for combinatorial optimization and mechanism design, which is usually referred to as learning-augmented algorithms (mechanisms).
